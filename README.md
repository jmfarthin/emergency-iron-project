# Emergency Iron Workout App




## What Is Emergency Iron? And Why Does It Exist?

This project is motivated by a question familiar to many gymgoers, "What the heck should I be doing right now?"

Emergency Iron is the answer. 

Intended for those at the novice to intermediate level, Emergency Iron can generate a workout, show you how to do it and 
let you start training immediately. 

No more staring at rows of equipment to figure out what to do next, and no more staring at other gymgoers to learn proper form.

With just a few clicks you are creating a workout plan, shown how to do it, and can be in-and-out of the gym with minimal idling.

## Insights Gained

During the course of this project we learned that simpler is better when it comes to designing an app for the gym.

It can be crowded and noisy in the gym, and the less time spent fumbling with internet and youtube searches, is more time making sweet, sweet gains.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.


## Features

The primary feature of Emergency Iron is the Workout Generator. It allows users to pick which part of the upper or lower workout "split" they want to do, and generates a list of five exercises they can do.

The second feature searches youtube for videos of the desired exercises and populates them inside the app. This allows a "one-stop-shop" of finding a workout and then seeing how it is safely and effectively executed. Proper form is critical! (Just because the guy next to you is ripped doesn't mean he's doing his workout the right way!)


## Tests

If you run into any issues with the app's functionality, shoot one of us a message at our github homepages with the following-

1. The issue you are having
2. The internet browser and version you are using

We want this app to help as many people as possible, and would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks in advance!




## Stop Thinking. Start Training. Emergency Iron.
